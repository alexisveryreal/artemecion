## Plans
- I was originally planning on making this some time of service where it would email the users to remind them that their bill is due soon, but I didn't want to add to the email bloat that we are all accustomed to.
- I am thinking of displaying some charts in the future however possibly to see how your spending may look like a year from now with current subscriptions, etc.
